# Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis

This project classifies Amazon product reviews into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

## Features
- Text preprocessing
- Model comparison: SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy and F1 Score
- Streamlit app for real-time predictions

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app/app.py
```

## Dataset
Uses a subset of the Amazon product reviews (Books category).

## Outputs
- Trained SVM model and TF-IDF vectorizer
- Model performance bar plot

# 📘 Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis

This project is a machine learning application that analyzes the sentiment of Amazon product reviews. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and multiple classification models to determine whether a review expresses a **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiment.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to build and evaluate sentiment classification models using Amazon product reviews data. The models are trained using TF-IDF vectorization and compared using accuracy and F1 score metrics. A Streamlit web app is also included for interactive prediction.

## 🧠 Models Used

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** – RBF kernel
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Logistic Regression**

> ✅ Decision Tree was trained but excluded from the final comparison due to overfitting tendencies.

## 📊 Model Evaluation

| Model              | Accuracy | F1 Score (Macro Avg) |
|-------------------|----------|----------------------|
| SVM               | ✅ Best  | ✅ Best              |
| Naive Bayes       | Good     | Good                 |
| Logistic Regression | Moderate | Moderate           |

Evaluation metrics used:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score (macro average across Positive, Negative, Neutral)

All metrics were visualized in a bar chart.

## 🧪 Input/Output Demo

```
Input:  "The product quality was amazing and delivery was quick."
Output: "Predicted Sentiment: Positive"
```

---

## 🌐 Streamlit Web App

To launch the interactive sentiment analyzer:

```bash
cd app
streamlit run app.py
```

Paste your review and click “Analyze” to see the predicted sentiment.

---

## 🧹 Preprocessing Steps

- Text cleaning (removing punctuation, lowering case)
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Balanced dataset using equal class distribution
- Train/test split

---
