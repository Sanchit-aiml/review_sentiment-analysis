# review_sentiment-analysis
This project uses machine learning to classify Amazon book reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. After preprocessing the text with TF-IDF, four models (SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) are trained and compared using Accuracy and F1-Score. The best model is deployed via a Streamlit app for real-time sentiment prediction.
